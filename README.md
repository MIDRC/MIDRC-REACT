## :information_source: Overview

The MIDRC Representativeness Exploration and Comparison Tool (REACT) is a tool designed to compare the representativeness of biomedical data. By leveraging the Jensen‚ÄëShannon distance (JSD) measure, it provides insight into the demographic representativeness of datasets within the biomedical field. It also supports monitoring historical data for changes in representativeness. Developed by MIDRC, it assesses how well data within the open data commons represent the US population and can be adapted for other data needs.

## :wrench: Features

- **Jensen‚ÄëShannon Distance Calculation**: Uses the JSD measure to assess data representativeness.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Enables comparisons between various datasets.
- **Biomedical Focus**: Tailored for biomedical data analysis.
- **Historical Data**: Supports monitoring changes over time.

## :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Background

The methodology is based on the 2023 paper by Whitney et al. titled [‚ÄúLongitudinal assessment of demographic representativeness in the Medical Imaging and Data Resource Center open data commons‚Äù\[1\]](#1). This paper provides the theoretical approach for using JSD.

## Technologies

**Technologies used with this application:**
- Python
- PySide6
- numpy, scipy, pandas

A `requirements.txt` file is provided for installing dependencies.

## Getting Started

### Configure YAML

First, create your own `jsdconfig.yaml` file to select which data to load by default using the provided example file:

- Ensure the filename is correctly specified and include a human‚Äëreadable name for display in plots.
- See the *Generating custom Excel files* section for details.
- Run the following command to copy the example configuration:

  ```bash
  cp jsdconfig-example.yaml jsdconfig.yaml
  ```

### Run Application

To start the application, run:

`python main.py`

### Generating Plots and Figures

* Use the drop‚Äëdown menus to select files for comparison.
* A checkbox is provided next to each drop‚Äëdown to display individual plots.
*  Note: Displaying multiple files simultaneously may require a 4k monitor.

### Generating Custom Excel Files

* Use the MIDRC, CDC, and Census Excel files as examples.
* For each date, ***cumulative sums are expected***.
* **Each attribute should have its own sheet** so it is automatically parsed.
* Where matching column names exist across sheets, JSD is calculated.
* ***A Date column is required*** and should be sorted. Please see how the census data is loaded using the example config file if your data does not have multiple dates.
* The `remove column name text` parameter adjusts for `(CUSUM)` suffixes in the MIDRC-generated data, and is optional.

### Layout and Loading of CSV/TSV Files

The application supports CSV/TSV files as well as Excel:
* CSV files use comma\-separation; TSV files use tabs.
* The file options dialog adjusts based on file type.
* ***Multi\-Dimensional Distances:*** The usage of multi-dimensional distances (FAMD, Aggregate) requires the full data in CSV or TSV format rather than just cumulative sums..
* **File\-specific Persistence:** Saves settings for each file.
* **Default Fallback:** Loads the last used settings if no file data is found.
* **Column Selection:** The dialog allows selecting which columns will be used in the display, and all columns selected are used for the multi-dimensional distances.
* **Numeric Column Selection:** You may set which columns are numerical instead of categorical, as well as setting how to bin the data for categorical distances. The GUI provides options for a range of values for the bins, and you may adjust the binning by editing the YAML content provided after creating the default bins.

The application can load TSV files downloaded directly from data.midrc.org or via the gen3 interface to MIDRC using the plugin included in the plugins directory.

### GUI Manipulation

* Plots and figures are movable, resizable, or can be hidden.
* Right‚Äëclick on any menu or title-bar area to view available dock widgets.
* Keyboard shortcuts allow copying JSD values and dates as tab‚Äëdelimited data for Excel or notebooks.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10 or higher
* [Git](https://github.com)

### Cloning

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MIDRC/MIDRC-REACT.git
```

### Installing Requirements

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r MIDRC-REACT/requirements.txt
```

### Starting

Start the project using:

```bash
cp MIDRC-REACT/jsdconfig-example.yaml MIDRC-REACT/jsdconfig.yaml
python MIDRC-REACT
```

Alternatively, from within the `MIDRC-REACT` directory, you can also run:

`python .`
